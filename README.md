# SwapWords

A minimalistic puzzle game I'm making in C# with Unity. The gameplay is like Candy Crush crossed with Scrabble.

This page will be updated when the game is done.

Everything in this game is made by me except for the font (Mond) and the sound effects (Kenney Asset Library).

The words used in the game are taken from here: http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html
