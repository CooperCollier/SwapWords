# SwapWords

A minimalistic puzzle game I made in C# with Unity. The gameplay is like Candy Crush crossed with Scrabble.

Everything in this game is made by me except for the font (Mond) and the sound effects (Kenney Asset Library).

The words used in the game are taken from here: http://www.mieliestronk.com/wordlist.html
